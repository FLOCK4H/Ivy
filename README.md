<h2>About</h2>

Ivy was meant to be an interactive AI assistant with it's own chat environment,
the project was dumped but this repository can serve as a pretty good base for an AI interface made using React.js

<h2>Running</h2>

To install necessary dependencies:

    npm install

To start the development server:

    npm start

<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
